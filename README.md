# UHI_Baltimore_EnergyMeteorology
Determining Current and Future UHI for Baltimore, MD
Project Outline:
Determine the current Baltimore Urban Heat Island (UHI) and use local weather data and weather data from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to estimate the impact of Climate Change on the Baltimore UHI in 2050.
---> Evaluate how well CMIP historical simulations capture the observed temperature patterns at urban and rural stations near Baltimore, and estimate the regional-scale bias in representing the Baltimore UHI.

Using the following experiments from CMIP:
Historical
SSP2-4.5 — this is a medium level projection which is plausible with some regulations
SSP3-7.0 — this is the projection if actions that lead to climate change are unmitigated 

Variable:
Near surface air temperature

Model:
GFDL-ESM4 (USA)
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory - Earth System Model 4

Outline:
1. Use Baltimore weather station data to classify Baltimore current UHI
2. Use CMIP to verify/compare classification
3. Bias correction (if needed)
4. Apply to the 2 future projection models for Baltimore
5. Analyze how these climate change models and impact UHI


Initial Hypothesis:
In 2050, in both models, the UHI for Baltimore will increase significantly. This increase will be caused due to higher temperatures and due to the current cooling mitigation strategies not working at never before seen elevated temperatures.
